# Work Day Planner

This project is a daily planning calendar. The user can input task to do throughout the work day hours of 9-5. When the user clicks the save button the task will be added to the calendar. When the user views the calendar throughout the day they can see the color coordinated hours to tell if the time for that task has already passed (grey), if the task is current (red), or the task is yet to come (green).
